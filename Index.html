			Hi, my name is Sin Lin and most of my friends call me Syiling for easier remember.  I graduated from University Utara Malaysia with a Bachelor of Technology Management in the year 2018.  During the internship, I enrolled in a digital marketing professional certificate program and started my 1st career as a digital marketing trainer, and I am also one of the Eusahawan Certified Trainer under MDEC.

			One of my greatest pleasure, I am trying to work as a digital marketing freelancer this year.  Then until one day during MCO, I found that I still love to draw since I was a child and this is my hobby. I gave up pursuing my passion when my dad passed away, that time I was only 10 years old. This is because that drawing will remind me of him, the one who always brings me to art competition and encourage me along the way.  I start to wondering why not this passion leads me into the art and digital design field and I am sure my dad will be very proud when he knows that I am doing good.  From there, I started to learn professional Adobe series design software to upskills myself and chase my dream.  One of my dreams is to master all the design technologies and become one of the top digital designers in Malaysia.

			I can do simple digital design now, but I find web design inspiring, exciting, and I’ll go on about it for hours.  I decided to put my focus on web design and development as before this I have been creating a few clean, elegant, and creative designs website using WordPress and Canva design tool.  I am enjoying each new project as I get it.  While learning adobe software, now is the great timing to learn some coding. After completing my learning from this course (web development) in BAC, I believe this will be another weapon for me to build more functioning and hand- coded website.

		<p>
			Through my experiences in digital marketing, I have come to meet some of the talented people in, who have taught me much.  When I design, I always try to be unique and push the boundaries.  So now you know a bit about me.  Let's connect, head over to add me a friend, and leave me a message!
